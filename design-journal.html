        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response:There’s nothing super specific I’m looking to learn about in this class, but overall I just want to maintain a better understanding of web design, and want to feel somewhat comfortable with coding. As of now my knowledge is very basic (I usually use premade website setups if I’m looking to create a site), and I think it would be really cool to learn how to make my own website from scratch. </p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Design Journal Prompt for week two: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: I’m planning to focus on one of my favorite artists, Frank Ocean. I obviously want to spotlight his albums, as well as a little bio about him, other work he’s been in, his upcoming events, etc. I’m hoping to use type and color to bring cohesion throughout the site, and use layout as a way to make it unique. When choosing colors, I’m going to experiment a lot with the colors used in his albums and hopefully incorporate them throughout the pages. I want a variety of type, but definitely am making sure to use a lot of bold typefaces because that’s what his branding is known for. I’m still debating if I would like to stick to black and white imagery, or if I should put in come colored.</p>

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>Prompt: I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website. This user could be you, it could be someone similar to you, it could be someone completely opposite from you, it could even be a non-human animal or an alien or an amoeba. You get to choose. Really imagine what they are like in their mind. What do they spend their time on? what are their hobbies, clothes, music, favorite foods, books, tv. What's their personality like? Once you've imagined this person write about them.</p>
        <p>Response: Since my website is devoted to Frank Ocean and his journey through music, I imagine the person who would enjoy my website to be someone who has as much as an appreciation for music as I do. They like to know the history and process behind producing a song or album, they do much more than just listen to the music. I imagine them to be well educated, modern/hip, and very open minded. Maybe they have a cool hair color, I’m sure their style is very edgy--like a street style. Someone I’d love to be friends with.

        <h2>Week Four</h2>
        <p>Prompt: After readin the two articles, make a list of 5 things to keep you going when you feel resistance or discomfort</p>
        <p>Response: First I will organize the steps to complete the tasks, so I feel less overwhelmed. Next I need to remember the reason I’m doing it. Then I should remind myself how good it will feel when it’s completed. Fourth is to create some sort of reward for myself to look forward to when I’m finished. And last is enjoy the reward!
